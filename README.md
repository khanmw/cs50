Project name: Project 0

Description: I created a HTML/CSS site that drills down into financial and corporate details of Microsoft.

Table of Contents: 
  1) Index: Portfolio "splash page" that lists stocks in a portfolio. The index page drills down to 4 other pages, but only for Microsoft.
  2) Summary page that provides high-level information on Microsoft (e.g., stock price)
  3) Statistics page provides some financial details on Microsoft (e.g., Return on Equity)
  4) Executives page provide information on top Micosoft executive (e.g., CEO)
  5) Analysis page provides analyst estimates and other details

Features: Per Project 0's requirements, I added the following functionality:
  1) The website contains five  .html pages
  2) Each page hyperlinks to one other and is formatted as an unordered list.
  3) The index page lists images of corportate logos.
  4) The index page ("Portfolio Page") uses bootstrap as stylesheet and formats the company logos using two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes within Bootstrapâ€™s grid model.
  5) 
Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.
Your stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.
You must use Bootstrap 4 on your website, taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component.
Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.

Credits: I used data from Yahoo Finance and logos from Google search results.
