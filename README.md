Project name: Project 0

Description: I created a HTML/CSS site that drills down into financial and corporate details of Microsoft.

Table of Contents: 
  1) Index: Portfolio "splash page" that lists stocks in a portfolio. The index page drills down to 4 other pages, but only for Microsoft.
  2) Summary page that provides high-level information on Microsoft (e.g., stock price)
  3) Statistics page provides some financial details on Microsoft (e.g., Return on Equity)
  4) Executives page provide information on top Micosoft executive (e.g., CEO)
  5) Analysis page provides analyst estimates and other details

Features: Per Project 0's requirements, I added the following functionality:
  1) The website contains five .html pages.
  2) Each page hyperlinks to one other and is formatted as an unordered list.
  3) The index page lists images of corportate logos.
  4) The index page ("Portfolio Page") uses bootstrap as stylesheet and formats the company logos using two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes within Bootstrapâ€™s grid model.
  5) The index page also makes use of the alert Bootstrap 4 component when stating the disclaimer, "For education purposes only". Consequently, this page also employs @media "print-only" class to only print "Print for education purposes only" when the page is printed via printer. I realize this is a reprint of the Bootstrap 4 alert, "For education purposes only," but I'm doing this to fulfill the requirement of Project 0--not for asthetics. 
  6) The index page also references style.css. Style.css employs several properties. For example, the ".mytable" class defines properties for border, border-collapse, font-family, font-size, while the "#Summary_title" ID sets properties such as font color and font-family.  
  7)
Your stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.

Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.

Credits: I used data from Yahoo Finance and logos from Google search results.
